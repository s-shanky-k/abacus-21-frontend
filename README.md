This repository contains the frontend code of the official **Abacus'21** website. This version of Abacus is going to be one of its kind - A symposium completely online.

Such a one-of-a-kind symposium needed a one of kind website. Hence the entire website is themed in **NEON** style with meticulous detail. The various neon themed components used throughout the website can be found in the components folder.
